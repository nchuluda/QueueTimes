# QueueTimes

SwiftUI App that utilizes the Queue-Times.com API to fetch current wait times for amusement park attractions.

Ride wait times using this API are updated every 5 minutes. To minimize reliance on cell signal or wifi while in the park, data is saved locally each time a call is made. Further calls are not necessary until fresh data becomes available.
